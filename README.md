# Epai_session_12_revise


Here we build a calculator package with below functions and their derivative Though functions and their derivatives are written in same module yet their call is split seperately for functions and derivatives.

For functions: import calculator - this will allow access to all functions not derivations. from calculator import derivatives - this will give access only to derivations

Build a calculator package that has separate module for: sin, cos, tan, tanh, SoftMax, Sigmoid, ReLU, log and e
The modules shall include their derivatives as well
If we do import calculator, we should be able to access all the above function (except deviratives)
For derivates we must do: from package import derivatives.
Outputs are returned as well as printed using only f-string
